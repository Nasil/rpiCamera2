Canny Edge Detection
====================
Works the following way:

1. Convert the canvas image to grayscale
2. Smooth the image to reduce noise as much as possible.
In this implementation, Gaussian filter can be applied (max kernel size is 21).
3. Determine the gradient intensity (amount of change) and direction for each pixel.
This is done by convolving image with the chosen filter.
Currently, there are 3 operators you may choose from:
  * Sobel
  * Prewitts
  * Cross
4. Thin the resulting edges with non-maximum suppression.
5. Remove weak/false edges.
A process called hysteresis is used where there are two thresholds--high and low--to be compared to each pixel.

## Usage
You'll need [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) installed.
Go to root directory of the project and start by entering the following on your terminal:
```
node js/server.js
```
Access program on port 8000.

## TODO
+ [ ] Cleanup image uploading.
+ [x] Fix non-maximum suppression thresholding (especially bad with Cross filter)
+ [x] Add other filters
